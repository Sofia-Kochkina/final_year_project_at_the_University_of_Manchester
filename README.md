This code allows to perform standard visualisation and analysis of bulk RNAseq data:
  * dispersion plot
  * volcano plot
  * tSNE plot
  * PCA plots with loadings with the opportunity to change the PCs shown
  * annotated gene expression heatmaps (hierarchical clustering)
  * GO enrichment analysis
  * Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
